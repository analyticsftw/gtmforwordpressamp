Installing support for Google Tag Manager in Accelerated Mobile Pages for Wordpress

This uses your Wordpress theme's functions.php file to output a Google Tag Manager snippet and dataLayer adapted for the AMP format, which does not support JavaScript by default.
It is highly recommended to use a child theme for this.
